I can try to debug why the program is so slow by removing all of the other things in the draw_landmarks_on_image function but still keeping the return statement

Maybe the documentation on that google website is just old or something. Using something like mp.solutions.hands seems to work better and is even what chatGPT suggested

Follow dimensions on docs in frame size test gesture recognizer model. Create own model with mediapipe model maker

Other things I can do to make my code better:
GPU acceleration
Paralell processing
Skip some frames for processing.
